## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-15

### üéâ Welcome to CMMS Identity Service v1.0.0!

We're excited to announce the official release of the CMMS Identity Service, a comprehensive identity and access management solution designed specifically for the CMMS Platform. This release represents months of development and brings enterprise-grade security features to your maintenance management system.

### üîê What is the CMMS Identity Service?

The CMMS Identity Service is the backbone of user authentication and authorization for the entire CMMS Platform. Think of it as the security guard for your maintenance management system - it handles everything from user login to determining what each user can see and do within the platform.

### üöÄ Major Features Introduced

#### **JWT Authentication with Swagger UI Integration**

**What it does:** JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication provides secure, stateless authentication for your users. Unlike traditional session-based authentication, JWT tokens contain all the information needed to identify a user and their permissions.

**Why it matters:** 
- **Security**: Tokens are cryptographically signed and can't be tampered with
- **Scalability**: No need to store session data on the server
- **Performance**: Faster authentication checks
- **Developer Experience**: Interactive testing directly in Swagger UI

**How to use it:**
1. Users log in with their username and password
2. The system returns a JWT token (like a digital ID card)
3. Users include this token in all subsequent requests
4. The system validates the token and grants access accordingly

**Swagger UI Integration:**
We've made testing incredibly easy by integrating JWT authentication directly into Swagger UI. Developers can now:
- Log in through the Swagger interface
- Automatically include their authentication token in all requests
- Test protected endpoints without leaving the browser
- See exactly what each endpoint requires

#### **SMS-Based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

**What it does:** Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide something they know (password) AND something they have (phone for SMS codes).

**Why it matters:**
- **Enhanced Security**: Even if someone steals a password, they can't access the account without the SMS code
- **Compliance**: Many industries require MFA for sensitive systems
- **User Trust**: Users feel more secure knowing their accounts are protected
- **Audit Trail**: Clear records of authentication attempts

**How it works:**
1. User logs in with username and password
2. If MFA is enabled, the system sends a 6-digit code via SMS
3. User enters the code to complete the login
4. Only then do they receive their JWT token

**Kavenegar Integration:**
We've partnered with Kavenegar, a leading SMS provider, to deliver reliable, fast SMS messages. The integration includes:
- Automatic SMS delivery for verification codes
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Support for multiple countries and phone number formats

#### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System**

**What it does:** RBAC is a method of restricting system access based on the roles of individual users. Instead of giving each user specific permissions, you assign them roles, and roles have permissions.

**Why it matters:**
- **Simplified Management**: Instead of managing hundreds of individual permissions, you manage a few roles
- **Consistency**: Users in the same role have the same access
- **Security**: Principle of least privilege - users only get access they need
- **Compliance**: Easy to audit who has access to what

**How it works:**
1. **Roles**: Groups like "Administrator", "Technician", "Manager"
2. **Permissions**: Specific actions like "Create User", "View Reports", "Edit Equipment"
3. **Assignment**: Users are assigned roles, roles have permissions
4. **Enforcement**: The system checks permissions before allowing actions

**Permission Auto-Generation:**
We've made it even easier by providing templates for common permission sets:
- **User Management**: Create, read, update, delete users
- **System Administration**: Full system access
- **Reporting**: Generate and view reports
- **Audit**: View audit logs and system history

#### **Multi-Tenant Architecture**

**What it does:** Multi-tenancy allows multiple organizations (tenants) to use the same application while keeping their data completely separate.

**Why it matters:**
- **Cost Efficiency**: Multiple organizations share infrastructure costs
- **Data Isolation**: Each tenant's data is completely separate
- **Customization**: Each tenant can have their own configuration
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new tenants without additional infrastructure

**How it works:**
- Each organization gets their own tenant
- All users, roles, and permissions are scoped to the tenant
- Data is completely isolated between tenants
- Each tenant can have their own configuration and settings

#### **Professional API Versioning**

**What it does:** API versioning allows us to make changes to the API while maintaining backward compatibility for existing clients.

**Why it matters:**
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing applications continue to work
- **Gradual Migration**: Clients can upgrade at their own pace
- **Feature Development**: We can add new features without breaking existing ones
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation for each API version

**How it works:**
- **URL Versioning**: `/api/v1/users`, `/api/v2/users`
- **Header Versioning**: `X-API-Version: 1.0`
- **Media Type Versioning**: `application/json;version=1.0`
- **Swagger Documentation**: Separate documentation for each version

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### **Clean Architecture with CQRS**

We've implemented Clean Architecture with the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern:

**Commands**: Handle all write operations (create, update, delete)
**Queries**: Handle all read operations with filtering and pagination
**Benefits:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between read and write operations
- **Scalability**: Can optimize reads and writes independently
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify
- **Testability**: Easier to write unit tests

#### **Comprehensive Validation**

Every input is validated using FluentValidation:
- **Input Validation**: Ensures data is in the correct format
- **Business Rules**: Enforces business logic and constraints
- **Security**: Prevents malicious input
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages for invalid input

#### **AutoMapper Integration**

Efficient object mapping between different layers:
- **Performance**: Fast object transformation
- **Maintainability**: Centralized mapping configuration
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time checking of mappings
- **Flexibility**: Easy to customize mappings

#### **Nullable Reference Types**

Enhanced type safety throughout the application:
- **Compile-time Checking**: Catches null reference errors at compile time
- **Code Quality**: Forces developers to handle null cases explicitly
- **Documentation**: Code is self-documenting about nullability
- **Reliability**: Reduces runtime null reference exceptions

### üìö Documentation and Testing
